# Superstore Sales Analysis
##### *PREPARED BY ABRAHAM MAURICE* 

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The superstore dataset provides sales and profit data for a variety of products across different categories and regions. 
The goal of this project is to analyse the data and identify insights that can help the company improve its business performance. 
Specifically, I aim to answer questions such as: which regions have the highest sales and profit? Which product categories are the most profitable? What are the most profitable products? 
By answering these questions, I hope to provide recommendations for the company on how to optimize its products offerings and improve its revenue and profitability. 

### DATA CLEANING PROCESS
- Once I have defined the problem, I need to gather the data Iâ€™ll need to analyse and also clean the data to ensure it is accurate, complete, and consistent. 
- Here is the primary dataset used for this analysis : [Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)

 #### TOOLS 
- I will use the Jupyter notebook  in Python for the data cleaning process.
- The libraries we will be using includes:
  1. Pandas for *data cleaning and analysis.*
  2. Matplotlib.pyplot for *visualisation.*

One of the most used method for getting a quick overview of the DataFrame, is the head() method. The head() method returns the headers and a specified number of rows (default number of rows = 5), starting from the top.

Let's view the first five rows of our dataset.
